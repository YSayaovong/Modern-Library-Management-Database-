This will be a 3 page (initial) proposal for your own database. plus cover sheet That is, I will ask you to cook up a database in  an area of your own choosing, with a minimum number of entities, "attributes" and fact types. ( New ti,es roman 12pt double spaced)

The proposal will include

'1. a cover sheet : Your name, course, project title, date

2. Introduction and why you chose this area and the expected value of doing so. 

3. Requirements: what questions your DB could answer ( minimum of 5) 

4.ORM diagram of your db ( more details of the minimum complexity will follow)

e.g. subtypes, but see the labs that we will be doing as examples) ( up through lab 3

5. Relational schema derived from your ORM diagram

6. Your final project will implement the relational schema

construct a database and write queries to answer the 

questions of  step 3. 

7. References

8. Summary & Conclusions 

For example: ( as of sept 15 2023)

Say you are interested in sports cars. Entity types could include { SportsCar(subtype of Electric, Gas, Diesel?) Manufacturer ( subtype of US, Foreign or more specific), Horsepower, brake mode, liter displacement, top speed, price(new car, used car) , Date of first issue ( date of withdrawal - Edsel, Nash. . ),

maintainence costs (TCO), number of such cars in operation,. . racing credentials (TRD, Le mans. . Number of cars in a given  Country,   celebrities driving this car!! ( I have seen utubes like this!) and hundreds more questions I /you could come up with...

Draw an ORM using at least 4 of these entity types

Write down 5 questions your Info base can answer ( or will be able to answer)

Derive and show the relational schema for the your ORM. This is for the initial proposal, the final submission will include the other factors not appearing in this submission.

Summarize:  what you have done so far ( job flow so far) where did you find your data?and discovered so far ( lack of data, too much data :-), too many entities!, 

Conclusion: (This is NOT the same as a summary, this is future thinking). What new thoughts has this info base generated what new areas could this lead to???

 

NOTE: Your final ORM should be at least as complex as Lab 3, i.e and must contain

1. one ternary fact type

2. Two subtypes

3. One external  preferred identifier

4. One mandatory inclusive constraint
